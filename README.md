This is an assignment project for PM2 module.
The base project is first developed by Professor Dr.Axel Schmolitzky and further edited by me based on the tasks that were assigned by the professor.
This project is built to implement inheritance, packaging the classes, error handling, testing with JUnit, abstract classes and GUI development with JavaFX in practical use cases.

Disclosure: I did not come up with the idea for this project nor coded the GUI and functionalities myself alone.

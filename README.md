This is an assignment project for PM2 module.
The base project is first developed by Professor Dr.Axel Schmolitzky and further edited by me based on the tasks that were assigned by the professor.
This project is used to learn inheritance, packaging the classes, error handling, testing with JUnit, abstract classes and GUI development with JavaFX.
